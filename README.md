## Acknowledgments:

#### Graphic Department

- Sara Infantino: I thank my dear friend Sara for helping me throughout the project's development. Her creative ability was truly invaluable, and her graphic skills allowed me to maintain consistent layout. The choice of an appropriate font and the countless contributions to graphic details are beyond my counting.

- Antonella Unida Antonietta: I express gratitude to my mother for assisting me with the graphics and being the first tester.

#### Testing Department

- Dario Del Ministro: I extend my thanks to my dear friend Dario for helping me during the initial website publications. He managed to identify a significant number of issues.

- Marco Bucchianeri: I appreciate my dear friend Marco for contributing to the application testing phase. He discovered a bug that kept me glued to the computer for at least 8 hours.
